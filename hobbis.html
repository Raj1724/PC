    <h3>Playing Cricket</h3>
    <p>Cricket is my favorite sport. When I get  some free time after my studies,I go outside to the ground with my friends and play cricket.
    Cricket is the game which requires physical fitness. The running between the wickets,
    fielding within the ground and stress bearing during batting and fielding make my body fit and mind fresh. So, after playing cricket when I study, I can better grab the concepts.</p>
<h3>Drawing/Painting</h3>
<p>In the universe, all things are created uniquely. The Best creation in the universe is humans. Everyone has its own Hobby according his or her skills.

Everyone wants to pass his recreational time by doing stuff which makes him pleased. Thus, hobbies are born.</p>
<h3>Book Reading</h3>
<p>Today, man lives in the world where hard work and efforts are necessary for survival. He has to work from dawn to dusk. These difficult and tiring activities make the brain dull and the body exhausted.

Continuous stress affects the mental capacity of people. The difficult tasks also cause rusting of mind and body.

So, there is a definite need of an action which causes mitigation of mind, relief of body and nourishment of thoughts. Hobby is an activity which did this thing.</p>
